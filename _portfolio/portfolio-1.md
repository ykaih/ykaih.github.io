title: "Carbon dioxicide fertilization effect on rice yields"
excerpt: "The past CO2 concentration has significantly contributed to increased rice yields, accounting for 16–26% of observed yield growth over 1990–2015. This indicates that if significant CO2 mitigation occurs, the CO2 fertilization effect will diminish, inducing a yield reduction.<br/><img src='/images/CCE-2025-Figure2.jpeg'><br> **Applied skills:** Pandel data regression model, prediciton, gridded climate data, climate risk analysis.<br> **Topic keywords:** CO2 fertilization effect, climate change, mitigation, rice yields.<br>"

A comparison between rice yields with observed historicalCO2 concentration and a counterfactual scenario, where CO2 is fixed at 1990 level, shows that the CO2 fertilization effect contributed an estimated 20% of the regional rice yield growth over 1990–2015. The countries with the largest yield growth from the evolving CO2 fertilization are China (26%), Bangladesh (25%), and South Korea (22%), and the country with the least growth is Afghanistan (16%).

Note: The blue lines after 1990 show the estimated rice yields with CO2 held fixed at the 1990 level. The red lines after 1990 show the estimated rice yields with the evolving observed CO2 levels. The colored shades indicate 95% confidence intervals.
