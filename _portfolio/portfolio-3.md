title: "Effect of a water quality regulation on land use change"
excerpt: "Implementation of total phosphorus (TP) loss reduction policy expedites the land use transition from croplands (particularly corn) to forestlands and decreases the agricultural profits, implying a potential conflict between bioenergy development and water quality.<br/><img src='/images/AWM-2022-Figure10.jpeg'>"

Without the total phosphorus (TP) loss reduction policy, most croplands are used for planting corn, cotton, and peanut since those are most profitable crops in the region. When the water quality target is imposed, the share of the hardwood land increases as hardwood has the lowest TP concentration among all crops. The figures also show the uncertainty in TP leaching induces dominant land use type in each sub-basin from croplands to forestlands.

Note: SP denotes stochastic phosphorus concentration; DY denotes deterministic yields while SY denotes stochastic yields. SP50 represents a deterministic model specification (i.e., 50% chance of meeting the TP target), and SP90/SP95/SP99 represent stochastic model specifications (i.e., 90%/95%/99% chance of meeting the TP target).
