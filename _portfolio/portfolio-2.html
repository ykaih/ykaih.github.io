Probability distribution of Potential evapotranspiration (PET) from 2025 to 2060 under different land use/land cover (LULC) and climate scenarios shows that, for various LULC scenarios involving corn and urban area expansion, the probability of facing water scarcity at least once from 2025 to 2060 is estimated to range from 0.2% to 3.8% and 0.7% to 2.6% under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios, respectively.

Note: LU0, 1, 2, and 3 denote LULC under baseline Scenario, Urban Expansion Scenario, AgExpansion Scenario, and Ag & Urban Expansion Scenario, respectively. The total area under the right-tail of the probability density curve intersected with the PET threshold vertical lines signifies the probability of water deficit occurrence under corresponding LULC scenarios (vertical dashed lines).
