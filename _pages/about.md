I am an environmental economist and data scientist with expertise in quantitative modeling, sustainable resource management, and ESG analytics. My work bridges economics, data science, and environmental policy, transforming complex datasets into actionable strategies for climate resilience, sustainable agriculture, renewable energy, and bioresource optimization.

With a Ph.D. in Environmental and Resource Economics and advanced skills in causal inference, econometrics, geospatial analytics, and optimization modeling, I have applied rigorous methods to evaluate:
* Bioenergy and bioproduct supply chains, including techno-economic and life-cycle assessments
* Environmental policy impacts on water quality, nutrient runoff, and greenhouse gas emissions
* Climate change risks to agricultural productivity and natural resources
* Consumer behavior in sustainability and renewable energy markets

I have collaborated with government agencies, research institutions, and industry partners to produce science-based solutions that guide policy, investment, and operational decisions. My projects have spanned U.S. agricultural systems, global bioenergy markets, and climate adaptation strategies.

Beyond research, I am passionate about making environmental data accessible and actionable. I bring experience in Python, R, GIS, machine learning, and ESG reporting frameworks, and I specialize in tailoring analytics to meet the needs of sustainability-driven organizations, environmental consultancies, and impact-focused investors.

Currently, I am seeking opportunities in:
* ESG data analytics (Environmental category focus)
* Sustainability and environmental consulting
* Data science roles in climate tech, renewable energy, or circular economy
* Applied economics positions in environmental/agriculture sectors

If you’re looking for someone who can translate complex environmental data into clear, impactful decisions, I’d be excited to connect.
