I am an environmental economist with expertise in bioenergy and natural resource management, policy impact evaluation, climate risk assessment, as well as incentive design and behavioral study (see [Publications Page](https://ykaih.github.io/publications/)). My work bridges environmental and climate physical impacts with economics, transforming complex data into actionable strategies for climate resilience, sustainable agriculture, bioresource supply chain management, and natural resources optimization.

With a Ph.D. in Environmental and Resource Economics and advanced skills in optimization modeling, econometrics, geospatial analytics, and choice experiment, I have applied these skills to evaluate:
* Bioenergy and bioproduct supply chains, including techno-economic and life-cycle assessments
* Environmental policy impacts on water quality, nutrient runoff, waste generation, and circular economy
* Climate change risks to agricultural productivity and natural resources
* Consumer behavior analysis for sustainable products

Beyond academic research, I also work with international development banks, NGOs, and industry partners to provide data-driven solutions that guide policy, investment, and operational decisions. My consulting projects have spanned circular economy,  economic impact of extreme weather, and climate risk assessment. I bring technical experience in econometrics, machine learning, geospatial analytics, and mathmatical programming (operation research), and I specialize in tailoring analytics to meet the needs of sustainability-driven organizations, environmental consultancies, and impact-focused stakeholders.
