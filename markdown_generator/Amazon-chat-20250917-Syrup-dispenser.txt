Hi Joel, I returned one item (Order #113-5882010-8217806), but it shows I returned another item (Order #113-5882010-8217806), which I didn't return. I think the order numbers got mixed up.
J
I understand your concern regarding the returned item.
Could you please help me with the item name?
K
They originally came in the same package, so I wonder if they mixed up the order numbers between the itmes
I returned " 14 oz Glass Syrup Dispenser, No Drip... (ASIN: B0CXVVMR7D)", but it shows I returned "YARRAMATE 16oz/470ml Glass Olive Oil... (ASIN: B0C9ZQ434J)" which I didn't return.
